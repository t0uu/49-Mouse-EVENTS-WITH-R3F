onContextMenu
onContextMenu is triggered when the context menu should appear.

On a desktop, we can show the context menu by inputting a RIGHT CLICK or CTRL + LEFT CLICK.

On a mobile device, we can display that menu by pressing down for some time.


onDoubleClick
onDoubleClick is triggered when we double click/tap on the same object.

The delay between the first and second click/tap is defined by the OS.

onPointerUp
onPointerUp is triggered when we release the click (left or right) or touch.

onPointerDown
onPointerDown is triggered when weâ€™ve just clicked or put our finger down.


onPointerOver and onPointerEnter
onPointerOver and onPointerEnter work exactly the same way.

The event is triggered when the cursor or finger just went above the object.

In native JavaScript, the mouseover event is slightly different than the mouseenter because it keeps triggering the event while the cursor enters children of the element being tested.

(we will talk about elements inside elements in R3F later).


onPointerOut and onPointerLeave
onPointerOut and onPointerLeave work exactly the same way.

The event is triggered when the cursor or finger just went out from the object.


onPointerMove
onPointerMove is triggered with each frame if the cursor has moved since the last frame, while above the object.


onPointerMissed
onPointerMissed will let you know if the user clicks outside of the object.
